<p><br /> where m is the mass of the ion, v is its velocity and z is the charge. When the ions pass through the two poles of a magnet, the charged particles take a curve path. The radius of curvature (r) of this path is:</p>

<p><br /> where B is the magnetic field strength.<br /> Combining the above two equations:</p>

<p><br /> Greater the value of m/z value larger is the radius of the curved path. The analyzer tube has a fixed radius of curvature and the magnetic field strength is varied such that all the ions reach the detector. <br /><br /> The mass spectrometer consist of five important components:<br /> a. Sample inlet: Here the sample under study is introduced into the chamber and the pressure inside the sample inlet is much lower than the outside pressure. A stream of molecules is produced here.<br /> b. Ion Source: The stream of molecules undergo ionization by various methods. Different compounds are ionized by different methods. This includes: Electron Ionization(EI), Chemical Ionization (CI), Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB) and Matrix Desorption Ionization (MALDI)<br /> c. Mass Analyzer: Separates the compound based on their mass to charge ratio (m/z). <br /> d. Detector: The ions that are deflected under the magnetic field are detected by the detector.<br /> e. Output: The signal is then recorded and processed by the data system. The output is the mass spectrum.</p>

<p><br /> <b>Electron Ionization method: </b><br /> In all the mass spectrometers regardless of the method used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of a molecule/compound, first the sample has to enter the mass spectrometer, then converted to charge particle by ion source before there are deflected by the magnetic field and detected. In EI-MS a beam of high energy electrons stike the incoming molecules. The electron and the molecules collide and the molecules form cations. A repleeer plate that carries a positive electrical potential directs the newly created ions towards a series of accelaration plates. A large potential difference (1 to 10 KV) is applied across these plates to produce a beam of positive ions. There is a repeller plate that absorbs any negative ions. Molecules that are not ionized are drawn off by the vacuum. Most of the molecules or atoms require 8 to 15 electron colts to get ionized. But usually the beam of electrons strike the molecules at 50 to 70 eV. For recording a simple proton NMR spectra deuterated solvents especially for the use of NMR are used.<br /><br /> Salient features of EI method:<br /> 1. Basic and well understood ionization method<br /> 2. Ideal for all volatile compounds with masses less than 1000.<br /> 3. Leads to molecular ion fragmentation, fragmentation provides structural information.<br /> 4. Mass spectra are reproducible.<br /> <!--When a nuclei of I=1/2 is placed in a magnetic field and is subjected to radiofrequency (RF) radiation of a particular frequency, nuclei absorbs the energy. The frequency at which this absorption takes place depends on: the characteristic of the nucleus, whether it is 1H, 13C, 19F and 31P, their chemical environment and on spatial location in the the magnetic field if that field is not everywhere uniform <br/> For recording a simple proton NMR spectra deuterated solvents especially for the use of NMR are used.<br> <center><img src="./images/image3.png" /></center></p><p><br><br> <h2><b>What does NMR Spectra tell you:</b></h2><br> <p>1)A low resolution NMR spectrum <br>      a)The number of peaks corresponds to the number of different hydrogen environment.<br>      b)The ratio of the areas under the peaks gives the ratio of the numbers of hydrogen atoms in each of these environments<br>      c)The chemical shifts give the information of type of hydrogen atoms present.<br><br>    2)High Resolution NMR Spectra<br>      The single peak in the low resolution spectrum splits into clusters of peaks The amount of splitting tells you about the number of hydrogens attached to the carbon atom or the neighboring  atoms.
