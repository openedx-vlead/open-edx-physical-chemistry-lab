<p>Principle behind all spectroscopic techniques is that under certain conditions, materials absorb or emit energy . Different spectroscopic techniques work over different ranges of frequency depending on the processes and magnitudes of the energy changes.<br /><br />Electromagnetic radiation: microwave, Infra Red, Visible and Ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma rays spectroscopy.<br /> Acoustic spectroscopy<br /> Other mechanical methods.</p>
